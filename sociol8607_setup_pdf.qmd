# \textcolor{white}{Agenda}

## Outline

Today we will install 

* Python (and uv)
  + virtual environments
* Positron (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) \newline for Python & R
* LaTeX for creating PDFs
* GitHub Desktop (and git)

\small 
(there are different steps for Windows vs. MacOS)

# \textcolor{white}{Python}

## Windows dependency

* Windows dependency: latest C++ Redistributable \newline
positron.posit.co/install.html

  + Prerequisites $\longrightarrow$ Windows

## Overview

Setting up Python is a two-step process...

* First we will install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
a tool for managing Python and Python projects

* Then we can use uv to install Python (& virtual environments inside Positron)

  + later on we will use also uv to install Python packages

* To get started, open: positron.posit.co/install.html

  + **Prerequisites** $\longrightarrow$ Python setup $\longrightarrow$ uv
  + click on **Installation** left-hand side (ToC)

## uv - MacOS

* Open a Terminal

  + command-space (to open Spotlight) and type Terminal.app (auto-complete should kick in)

  + the Terminal is a powerful tool for managing your file system and running programs
  (Positron has a built-in terminal!)

* Inside the terminal, type the following command \newline
  ```{bash}
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

  + (copy and paste from website)

  + If curl is not available, then try \newline
    ```{bash}
    wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

## uv - Windows

* Open a PowerShell (Windows equivalent to a terminal)

* Inside the PowerShell, type the following command \newline
  \tiny
  ```{bash}
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
  \normalsize

  + (copy and paste from website)

* Now close the PowerShell and open a new one

  + (this should ensure that PowerShell can find the newly installed uv tool)

## Python

* Now we can use uv to install Python!

* Inside the terminal or powershell, simply run \newline
  ```{bash}
  uv python install
  ```

  + this should install the latest version (3.14)

* In the future (if needed), you can install a different version of Python \newline
  ```{bash}
  uv python install 3.13
  ```

# \textcolor{white}{Positron}

## Positron

* Download Positron installer for Windows or MacOS \newline
 positron.posit.co/download.html

   + on Windows 11, this required 1.34GB of disk space

* After installing Positron and starting the program,
Windows 11 security feature may ask if you want to allow *KCserver*
(you do)

# \textcolor{white}{Virtual Environments}

## Motivation

* Python development moves [fairly rapidly](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)

  + Not all projects/packages are moving at the same speed, which can cause headaches.

* Consider the following...

  + Your Project 1 depends on Package A (version 2.7)

  + Your new Project 2 depends on Package A (version 3.1)

  + When you update Package A, Project 2 is good, but it breaks Project 1!

## Motivation (cont.)

* We can mitigate some of these problems by installing packages in separate locations

  + Project 1 looks in \newline `/home/l_yamal/proj1/packages/pkga_v27` \newline to find Packge A (version 2.7)

  + while Project 2 looks in \newline `/home/l_yamal/proj2/packages/pkga_v31` \newline where version 3.1 is installed

* These separate locations are implemented as \newline
**Virtual Environments**

## Python Virtual Environment

* For each project involving Python, you should set up a *virtual environment*

* Inside Positron, open (or create) the folder where you want to set up
your project: `File` $\longrightarrow$ `Open Folder...`

* Open the *Command Palette*

  + MacOS: command-shift-P
  + Windows: control-shift-P

* Type: `Python: Create Virtual Environment`

  + choose the uv option

# \textcolor{white}{\LaTeX}

## \LaTeX

* Positron comes installed with *quarto*, a publishing system
that can create documents, presentation, webpages, etc.

* Quarto uses LaTeX to create PDFs, which we can install by running
the following command in the Positron terminal \newline

  ```{bash}
  quarto install tinytex
  ```

  +  (takes a few minutes to run)

# \textcolor{white}{GitHub}

## Gintro

* Messy projects, messy code, and sharing/collaboration?

* GitHub to the rescue

  + GitHub is an on-line service that stores files, tracks versions,
  and more!

* `git` is the program used for *version control* (i.e.,
managing and tracking different versions of your files)
  
  + Positron adds features for running git on your computer [Positron's VC docs](https://positron.posit.co/git.html)

  + an excellent resource: [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Gintro (cont.)

* "and more" you say??

  + renders *markdown* code (used to format text)
  \newline test drive: https://markdownlivepreview.com
  
  + websites, e.g. 
  https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/
  
  + create different *branches* of you project
  
  + advanced features for software developers (making it popular
  and a common source for latest versions)

## GitHub

Sign up for a free GitHub account:

* https://github.com/signup

    + you will need to create a new username and password
    
    + the *Free* subscription will work just fine
    
    + there is also an [educational account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers)
    that provides more resources
    
    + a verification email will be sent (check spam folder)

* You may need to set up [2-Factor Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)

## GitHub Desktop

* GitHub Desktop is a user-friendly interface for `git`

* Download and install the GitHub Desktop application

* [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

  + for Windows & MacOS

* GitHub Desktop will present a Welcome Screen

    + sign in using the username and password you created previously

## git: concepts and actions

* **Clone** - copy a repository to your computer for the first time

* **Pull** - update your local copy of the repo with any new
changes on the remote repo

  + clone is basically a pull for the first time
  
  + you can also *fetch* - download changes (so you can inspect them)
  but do not sync them with your local repo

* Make new files and changes to your local repo, then **STAGE** all
the files you want to keep track of

  + this includes adding, renaming/moving, & removing files with
  any changes that you want to track

## GitHub: concepts and actions (cont.)

* **Commit** - save your changes (they are now tracked)

  + typically include a message describing the commit
  
  + this creates a new version (or snap shot) of your project
  
  + you can go back and look at previous commits (or revert to that
  version) and look at differences between commits

* **Push** - send your changes to GitHub

  + local repo will now be identical to remote repo

# \textcolor{white}{Extra}

## SHA-256 - Windows

* open PowerShell and run the following command
  \tiny
  ```{bash}
  Get-FileHash installer.exe -Algorithm SHA256 | Set-ContentPath f1.txt
  ```
  \normalsize

* copy & paste SHA-256 from website into a text file f2.txt
* then run the following in ps
  \footnotesize
  ```{bash}
  Compare-Object (Get-Content f1.txt) (Get-Content f2.txt)
  ```
  \normalsize

## SHA-256 - MacOS

* open Terminal and run the following commands
  ```{bash}
  sha256sum installer.dmg > f1.txt
  echo SHA-256-from-website > f2.txt1x
  ```
